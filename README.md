So there's a kind of a collection of all products on dpreview:

https://www.dpreview.com/products
example for Olympus _cameras_, not lenses:
https://www.dpreview.com/products/olympus/cameras?subcategoryId=cameras
example for "full" specs of a camera:
https://www.dpreview.com/products/olympus/slrs/oly_epl1/specifications

So each of those (links for a camera) would need to be followed and parsed to gather the info
...then store all that in some kind of data structure...
...a dict?
...a db?

Or from here maybe https://www.digicamdb.com/
